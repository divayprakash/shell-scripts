# Uptime
Find out the maximum time for which your system was working.

Files :  
0.1.sh : First working script.  
	 Does what the question asks only.

1.0.sh : Calculates total up time also but uses file creation.  
	 Thus is limited to my system only and code would need to be changed to run on another machine.

2.0.sh : The final version.  
	 Code does not rely on file-creation.  
	 Thus fully portable and can be executed on any system.  
	 There is some error in total up time so I'm removing that.

3.0.sh : Shows data start time, day and month  
	 Total up-time removed  
	 Bug-free

4.0.sh : Tried to incorporate month too.
	 Did not work out.  
	 To learn here : Coverting int values to char  
	 Checking equality of string values
